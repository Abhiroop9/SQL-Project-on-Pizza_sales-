# SQL-Project-on-Pizza_sales-

The SQL Pizza Sales Project is a practical exercise designed to enhance skills in SQL database management and data analysis. The project involves creating and managing a database for a fictional pizza restaurant. Key components of the project include:

# Data Insertion: Populating tables with sample data for customers, pizzas, ingredients, and orders. This step ensures a realistic dataset for analysis
# Queries: Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. Common queries include:

* Top 5 ordered pizza types along with their quantities
* Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered
* Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day
* Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue
* Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
* Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category

# Analyzing the query results to identify trends and patterns in sales. This can help the restaurant make informed business decisions, such as which pizzas to promote or which catagories to stock more. Also this project provides hands-on experience with SQL and demonstrates how database management and analysis can drive business strategy and decision-making.
